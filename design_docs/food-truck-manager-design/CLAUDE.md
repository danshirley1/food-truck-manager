# Food Truck Manager - Claude Context

## Project Overview
A portfolio showcase application featuring a Food Truck Manager simulation game. Players navigate scenarios like permits, supply chains, festival bookings, and customer interactions through decision-based gameplay.

## Development Approach
- **Web Application**: Next.js React frontend with AWS backend integration
- **Focus**: System design and architecture over complex game theory
- **AI Integration**: Generate scenario content and choices to minimize manual content creation

## Key Design Decisions

### 2025-09-07 - Initial Project Setup
- **Theme Selected**: Food Truck Manager (over Coffee Shop or Park Ranger)
- **Architecture**: JavaScript/TypeScript with AWS backend
- **AI Strategy**: Use AI for content generation (scenarios, choices) rather than complex game logic
- **Documentation Structure**: Created comprehensive design documentation hierarchy
- **Development Philosophy**: Keep game mechanics simple (resource deltas), let AI handle creative content

### 2025-09-07 - Core Game Design
- **Resource System**: 3 resources (money: -999 to 999, reputation: 0-100, energy: 0-100)
- **Game Length**: 15 turns representing 15 days of operation
- **Effect Constraints**: Individual effects limited to ¬±20, turn totals to ¬±30
- **Failure States**: Burnout (energy ‚â§ 0), reputation death (reputation ‚â§ 0), bankruptcy (money ‚â§ -500)
- **Victory Condition**: Complete all 15 turns successfully
- **Data Model**: TypeScript-first with Zod validation for AI safety
- **Difficulty Progression**: Early (1-5), Mid (6-10), Late (11-15) turns with escalating stakes

### 2025-09-07 - AI Integration & Content Strategy
- **AI Role**: Generate scenario narratives and choice labels, not game logic or effects
- **Content Safety**: Multi-layer validation (JSON schema, content moderation, effect bounds)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Static scenario library for AI failures, hybrid generation approach
- **Scenario Categories**: Customer service, supply management, equipment, permits, competition, weather, community events, crisis management, expansion
- **Caching Strategy**: Pre-generate common scenarios, context-aware cache keys
- **Cost Management**: Batch generation, smart caching, token optimization, budget alerts

## Commands to Remember
```bash
# Add any specific commands for this project here as they're discovered
```

## Design Documentation Structure
- `architecture/` - System design, data flow, AWS services
- `game-design/` - Game mechanics, scenarios, AI integration  
- `technical/` - Data models, algorithms, validation
- `ui-ux/` - Interface designs and user flows
- `deployment/` - Infrastructure and CI/CD

## Documentation Mandate
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Always update design documentation when making ANY design changes or decisions. This includes:
- Updating relevant design files when decisions are made
- Creating new documentation files as needed
- Maintaining traceability of all design decisions
- Ensuring all design evolution is documented in real-time

### 2025-09-15 - Next.js Web Application Complete
- **Next.js 14 Setup**: Modern React application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Shared Architecture**: Core game logic in shared module for reusability
- **React Components**: GameBoard, ScenarioCard, GameOverCard with responsive design
- **Game Hook**: useGame custom hook for React state management
- **Full Playability**: Complete web version with static scenario library
- **Unified Package Management**: Yarn workspace setup
- **Orchestrated Development**: Single `yarn dev` command starts all development servers
- **Static Content**: 8 curated scenarios across all difficulty levels

### 2025-10-04 - CLI Version Removed
- **Web-Only Focus**: Removed CLI application to simplify architecture
- **Streamlined Workspace**: Web and shared packages only
- **Updated Scripts**: Cleaned up all CLI-related build and dev scripts
- **Documentation Updated**: Design docs reflect web-only architecture

### 2025-10-04 - Refactored to Standard Next.js Structure
- **Removed Shared Package**: Moved all game logic into Next.js `/lib` directory
- **Standard Next.js Pattern**: Following Next.js best practices with `/lib` for business logic
- **Simplified Build**: No more workspace complexity, single Next.js app
- **Cleaner Imports**: All imports now use `@/lib/game` pattern
- **Updated Documentation**: Reflects new simpler architecture

### 2025-10-04 - Next.js Learning Phase: Server Components & API Routes
- **Learning Objective**: Understand Next.js App Router, Server Components, and API Routes
- **First Feature**: Move hardcoded scenarios to backend API endpoints
- **Server-Side Data**: Learn data fetching patterns with Server Components
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for game data
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Keep client-side working, add server features incrementally

## Current Architecture
```
/web (Single Next.js application)
  /src
    /app          # Next.js App Router pages & API routes
    /components   # React components (Client & Server)
    /hooks        # Custom React hooks
    /lib          # Game engine and logic
      /engine     # State management
      /types      # TypeScript definitions
      /scenarios  # Scenario system (moving to API)
      /game       # Main exports
```

## Current State: Fully Functional Web Game
- ‚úÖ Complete playable game with 8 static scenarios
- ‚úÖ Client-side game state management
- ‚úÖ API Routes for scenarios (moved from hardcoded)
- ‚úÖ Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- ‚úÖ Game mechanics: 3 resources, 15 turns, difficulty progression
